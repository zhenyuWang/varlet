As a result, Material style does not have a good experience in the mobile browser environment, and more flat and simple style is chosen to be put into the product. But as modern devices and new JS frameworks become more efficient at runtime processing, browsers have more free time, and the ability to process animations, and Material Design will bring a better experience to applications.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Special thanks</h3><p>Special thanks to <code>Yu Tiezhu-eddieyc@163.com</code> for the visual support of our component library documentation site, so as to help us continue to evolve.</p></div>',8),n=[r];function l(d,c,p,h,u,m){return i(),t("div",s,n)}var b=e(a,[["render",l]]);export{b as default};
